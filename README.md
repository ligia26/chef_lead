Automated scraping for chef's data

Approach 

Step 1: Gather Data and dive into the chef’s world in the USA; connections, events and platforms

Step 2: Filter the data, build a web scraping prototype that reduces the noise in data

Step 3: metrics; identify the results and measure the efficiency of the approach; testing

Main data sources:

1.Influencers Club – Chefs Email Database: This platform offers access to a database of over 23,620 chefs, allowing you to filter profiles based on specific criteria. It's particularly useful for targeted outreach and lead generation.

2.ChefDb – The Chef and Restaurant Database: ChefDb is a comprehensive database that offers detailed information about chefs and their associated restaurants. It's a valuable tool for understanding the professional backgrounds of chefs and identifying potential leads.

3.HireAChef.com – Personal Chef Directory: Managed by the United States Personal Chef Association, this directory connects you with personal chefs across the country, offering a pool of professionals for potential collaboration.

4.TargetNXT – Chefs Email List: TargetNXT provides a verified email list of chefs, cooks, and other food industry professionals. This resource can be instrumental in direct marketing campaigns and expanding your network within the culinary industry.

5.DataCaptive – Chefs Email List: DataCaptive offers a geo-targeted email list of chefs, enabling you to focus on specific regions. This can be particularly beneficial for localized marketing efforts and events.


Data Harvesting:

When using these pre-built databases, instead of big platforms like Linkedin or Yelp, data can be accessed by leveraging datasets with no scraping. However, even these datasets might need cleaning and validation like email verification, cross-checking linkedin profiles or filtering by location using python scripts.
Data can also be enriched to maximize its efficiency and accuracy. Available APIs ensure a smooth way to achieve this: 

Google Places API (Get restaurant details, website, ratings)
LinkedIn API (if accessible) (Job history, endorsements)
Yelp API (Reviews, business details)
Clearbit API (Find missing social media or company details).

Automation:

To make this whole process valuable and to maximize its efficiency, we need to find the optimal method to automatize it.
Here comes the pipeline creation that will continuously fetch, clean, enrich and update the data.

APIs + web scraping + data validation + enrichment + machine learning.

This script: 
✅ Loops through all A-Z chef pages
✅ Extracts chef details dynamically
✅ Handles pagination for larger lists
✅ Pushes data to Google Sheets

What worked well?
1.Efficiently retrieved data from an open-source DB
2.Enough data in order to draw some conclusions
3.The script can be automated even further, but it provides a solid base
4.Standardized format that allows putting data in an easy to use format


Biggest challenges?
1.Incomplete data: the newly added chefs have the city and restaurant provided while the others don't at first sight, need to dig in deeper
2.Some databases that are online might not be accessible through this mechanism as the might have CAPTCHAs or rate limits
3.Ensuring that the data is valid and the right one is challenging as websites have different structures and you might have to adjust methods
4.If the dataset grows to thousands of entries, optimizing scraping speed and storage efficiency becomes critical.

How could it be improved?

1.Automate Updates: schedule the scraper to run weekly or monthly; store historical data to track career progress and trends.
2.Better Data Visualization: use interactive dashboards (Tableau, Google Data Studio, Power BI) to analyze trends, input AI on trends.
3.Better Scraping techniques: use headless browsers (Selenium, Puppeteer) to bypass CAPTCHAs, implement proxy rotation to avoid getting blocked, use API endpoints if available (faster & more reliable than scraping raw HTML).
4.Expand the dataset using social media resources.
5.Clean data from duplicates and invalid values.
