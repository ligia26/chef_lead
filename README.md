Automated scraping for chef's data

Approach 

Step 1: Gather Data and dive into the chef’s world in the USA; connections, events and platforms

Step 2: Filter the data, build a web scraping prototype that reduces the noise in data

Step 3: metrics; identify the results and measure the efficiency of the approach; testing

Main data sources:

1.Influencers Club – Chefs Email Database: This platform offers access to a database of over 23,620 chefs, allowing you to filter profiles based on specific criteria. It's particularly useful for targeted outreach and lead generation.

2.ChefDb – The Chef and Restaurant Database: ChefDb is a comprehensive database that offers detailed information about chefs and their associated restaurants. It's a valuable tool for understanding the professional backgrounds of chefs and identifying potential leads.

3.HireAChef.com – Personal Chef Directory: Managed by the United States Personal Chef Association, this directory connects you with personal chefs across the country, offering a pool of professionals for potential collaboration.

4.TargetNXT – Chefs Email List: TargetNXT provides a verified email list of chefs, cooks, and other food industry professionals. This resource can be instrumental in direct marketing campaigns and expanding your network within the culinary industry.

5.DataCaptive – Chefs Email List: DataCaptive offers a geo-targeted email list of chefs, enabling you to focus on specific regions. This can be particularly beneficial for localized marketing efforts and events.


PROS AND CONS for DATA SOURCES:

ChefDb – Offers detailed profiles of chefs and their restaurant affiliations, making it useful for research. However, it does not focus on private chefs or provide direct contact details.
HireAChef.com – Specializes in private chefs, making it ideal for hiring professionals for catering and events. However, it lacks mass contact lists for large-scale outreach.
Influencers Club – Provides a large database of chefs but is more suited for broad outreach rather than private chef services.
TargetNXT – Offers a verified email list for direct marketing, though it is not specifically tailored for personal chefs.
DataCaptive – Provides geo-targeted email lists, useful for regional marketing, but the data may not always be up-to-date.


Data Harvesting:

When using these pre-built databases, instead of big platforms like Linkedin or Yelp, data can be accessed by leveraging datasets with no scraping. However, even these datasets might need cleaning and validation like email verification, cross-checking linkedin profiles or filtering by location using python scripts.
Data can also be enriched to maximize its efficiency and accuracy. Available APIs ensure a smooth way to achieve this: 

Google Places API (Get restaurant details, website, ratings)
LinkedIn API (if accessible) (Job history, endorsements)
Yelp API (Reviews, business details)
Clearbit API (Find missing social media or company details).

Automation:

To make this whole process valuable and to maximize its efficiency, we need to find the optimal method to automatize it.
Here comes the pipeline creation that will continuously fetch, clean, enrich and update the data.

APIs + web scraping + data validation + enrichment + machine learning.

This script: 
✅ Loops through all A-Z chef pages
✅ Extracts chef details dynamically
✅ Handles pagination for larger lists
✅ Pushes data to Google Sheets

What worked well?
1.Efficiently retrieved data from an open-source DB
2.Enough data in order to draw some conclusions
3.The script can be automated even further, but it provides a solid base
4.Standardized format that allows putting data in an easy to use format


Biggest challenges?
1.Incomplete data: the newly added chefs have the city and restaurant provided while the others don't at first sight, need to dig in deeper
2.Some databases that are online might not be accessible through this mechanism as the might have CAPTCHAs or rate limits
3.Ensuring that the data is valid and the right one is challenging as websites have different structures and you might have to adjust methods
4.If the dataset grows to thousands of entries, optimizing scraping speed and storage efficiency becomes critical.

How could it be improved?

1.Automate Updates: schedule the scraper to run weekly or monthly; store historical data to track career progress and trends.
2.Better Data Visualization: use interactive dashboards (Tableau, Google Data Studio, Power BI) to analyze trends, input AI on trends.
3.Better Scraping techniques: use headless browsers (Selenium, Puppeteer) to bypass CAPTCHAs, implement proxy rotation to avoid getting blocked, use API endpoints if available (faster & more reliable than scraping raw HTML).
4.Expand the dataset using social media resources.
5.Clean data from duplicates and invalid values.

Task 3:
1.Simplified onboarding process with progressive profiling
2.Follow-up strategy: personalized outreach, also on different means of contact: email, SMS
3.Referral program: offer bonuses for referring other chefs
4.Priority access: incentives for the first ones who join
5.Community building via podcasts and live webinars
6.Reminder emails for those who did not complete the onboard process but filled the form
7.Paid online ads: Facebook and Instagram

Task 4:

Partnership for chef acquisition - 3 target organizations:

1.Culinary institutes
2.Chef associations
3.Freelancer platforms for hospitality professionals

**Yhangry x Qwick Partnership Pitch Deck**

Slide 1: Unlock New Earning Opportunities for Hospitality Freelancers

**A High-Value Gig Opportunity for Qwick Chefs & Hospitality ProsSubtitle: How a partnership between Yhangry and Qwick can provide chefs and hospitality professionals with more earning potential, flexibility, and career growth.**

Introduction:

Qwick connects hospitality professionals with short-term, flexible job opportunities, allowing chefs to find work on their terms.

Yhangry is a private chef marketplace that enables chefs to book direct-to-client, high-paying gigs in private homes and events.

By partnering, we provide Qwick chefs with an additional revenue stream, a pathway to building their own brand, and a community of direct bookings without the instability of restaurant shifts.

Slide 2: Why This Partnership Matters

The Current Challenges in Hospitality Work:

Many chefs on Qwick rely on hourly gigs, which are often unpredictable and provide little job security.

Restaurant shifts can be demanding, with long hours, fluctuating schedules, and lower earning potential.

There are limited opportunities for independent chefs to establish their own personal brand and client base.

The Yhangry Solution:

Higher Earnings: Chefs set their own prices and keep the majority of their earnings.

Direct Client Relationships: Chefs build their personal brand and get recurring customers.

Full Flexibility: Work when, where, and for whom you want—without relying on third-party scheduling.

Exclusive Incentives for Qwick Members: First 3 bookings commission-free, priority placement in our chef network, and dedicated onboarding support.

Why It Works:

Qwick chefs are already accustomed to flexible work; this partnership expands their earning potential beyond traditional hospitality gigs.

Yhangry provides chefs with direct access to a premium clientele who are willing to pay more for custom, high-quality dining experiences.

Slide 3: How We Can Work Together

A Seamless Partnership for Chef Success:

Co-Branded Awareness Campaigns: Joint email, social media, and in-app promotions to introduce Yhangry as an exclusive high-value gig option for Qwick members.

Incentive Program: Qwick chefs receive first 3 bookings with zero commission, a fast-tracked onboarding process, and priority access to our most in-demand markets.

Educational Webinars & Training: Collaborate on virtual workshops and in-person networking events to help chefs maximize their earning potential.

Job Listings & Platform Integration: Feature Yhangry’s chef opportunities on Qwick’s job board and internal communications.

Cross-Promotion: Yhangry will feature Qwick as a recommended gig platform for chefs looking to diversify their work portfolio.

Next Steps:

Schedule a working session to finalize co-marketing and recruitment strategy.

Pilot the partnership with a select group of Qwick chefs to measure impact.

Scale the program based on data-driven insights, targeting major U.S. cities with strong demand for private chefs.

Together, we can provide chefs with more independence, better earnings, and the opportunity to build a lasting career.
