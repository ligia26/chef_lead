Automated scraping for chef's data

Approach 

Step 1: Gather Data and dive into the chef’s world in the USA; connections, events and platforms

Step 2: Filter the data, build a web scraping prototype that reduces the noise in data

Step 3: metrics; identify the results and measure the efficiency of the approach; testing

Data Harvesting:

When using these pre-built databases, instead of big platforms like Linkedin or Yelp, data can be accessed by leveraging datasets with no scraping. However, even these datasets might need cleaning and validation like email verification, cross-checking linkedin profiles or filtering by location using python scripts.
Data can also be enriched to maximize its efficiency and accuracy. Available APIs ensure a smooth way to achieve this: 
Google Places API (Get restaurant details, website, ratings)
LinkedIn API (if accessible) (Job history, endorsements)
Yelp API (Reviews, business details)
Clearbit API (Find missing social media or company details).

Automation:

To make this whole process valuable and to maximize its efficiency, we need to find the optimal method to automatize it.
Here comes the pipeline creation that will continuously fetch, clean, enrich and update the data.

APIs + web scraping + data validation + enrichment + machine learning.

This script: 
✅ Loops through all A-Z chef pages
✅ Extracts chef details dynamically
✅ Handles pagination for larger lists
✅ Pushes data to Google Sheets
